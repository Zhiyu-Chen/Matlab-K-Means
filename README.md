# Matlab-K-Means
This is a K-MEANS implementation by using matlab with GUI.

First, you should choose the number of clusters (k).

To generate data, you can 
(1)choose directly from the screen: click the mouse and end up inputting with 'enter';
(2)generate by your parameters (mean and variation).If you choose to generate k clusters, there will be k Q&A windows popping up for you to input the means and deviation of the distributions.

Click "K-means cluster", you will see the animation of clustering.
